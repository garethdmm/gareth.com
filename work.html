It was written using C++ with multithreading libraries, PHP, Thrift, Memcached, and several internal tools. It is served out of multiple datacenters, and scales infinitely with the computing resources it is given. Today the service is deployed and serving many millions of requests per day.</div>

It was the centerpiece of their presentation at the 2009 DEMO conference. I also wrote the first practical consumer application on the Primal Fusion platform as the winning entry for the in-office coding competition. Second place was a team of the founder and the director of platform development!</div>

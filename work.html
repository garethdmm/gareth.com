      <div class="tooltip">I wrote what is now a critical part of Facebook's security infrastructure: a backend service that helps keep out the non-humans. It was written using C++ with multithreading libraries, PHP, Thrift, Memcached, and several internal tools. It is served out of multiple datacenters, and scales infinitely with the computing resources it is given. Today the service is deployed and serving many millions of requests per day.</div>

      <div class="tooltip">AMD was my first software job, way back in 2007. I worked QA on the graphics driver installer software. I wrote test-suites, found bugs, the usual fun testing stuff. I remember AMD mostly as the place where things like software engineering fundamentals like "Source Control", "Release Management" and "Test Suites" started to make sense.</div>

      <div class="tooltip"><a href='http://www.primal.com'>Primal</a> threw me into the fire in 2009. Arriving with zero web-development experience, six weeks later my first project, a web-app that builds a website representation of the user's thoughts, was the centerpiece of their <a href='http://link.brightcove.com/services/player/bcpid980795693?bctid=14536664001'/>presentation</a> at the 2009 DEMO conference. I also wrote the first practical consumer application on the Primal Fusion platform as the winning entry for the in-office coding competition. Second place was a team of the founder and the director of platform development!</div>

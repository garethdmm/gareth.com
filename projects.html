        <div class="tooltip">If you have a high-school education you’ve probably written a paper or two, and been subjected to the tedious task of citing sources for that paper. <a href='http://quickcite.it'>QuickCite</a> minimizes this tedium.

        <div class="tooltip">Sometimes school just doesn’t scratch the creative itch, that’s why last November, myself and six of the best hackers I know locked ourselves in an office and tried to write a complete software product every day for a week. We called it <a href='http://7cubedproject.com'>7Cubed</a>: 7 Hackers 7 Apps 7 Days. Many of my side-projects since then have been offshoots of 7Cubed.</div>
